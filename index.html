          <h1>
            Make America Think Harder
          </h1>
          <p>Friends, I have taken some time this summer to learn about the candidates for the 2020 election and <a href="http://yang2020.com" title="Andrew Yang for President">Andrew Yang</a> really stands out.</p>

          <p class="goal">
            I wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to learn about Andrew Yang. In the first video, which is only 11 minutes, you can watch Andrew lay out his vision for how we need to transform our economy into a trickle-up, human-centered system.
          </p>

          <p>I do think he will win if his message gets out, and we need to make sure other politicians see how excited people are about his vision of <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/" title="Human centered capitalism">Human-centered Capitalism</a>.</p>

          <h2>
            Why share this?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am an idealist. When I shuffle off this mortal coil, I hope that my country, and the world, are firmly on the path of being a better place than when I was born.
          </p>
          <p>I would not normally share political content, but I think this is the most important vision a presidential candidate has expressed in my lifetime.</p>

            Does he have a shot at winning?
          </h2>
          <p>He is in a great spot. A few days ago I saw a comparison to Bill Clinton’s run in 1992 and he is polling at the same levels.</p>
          <p>Iowa and New Hampshire do not even vote until early 2020. However, much of the main-stream media decided not to cover him initially.</p>
          <p>This has changed, but I think for him to win <strong>WE</strong> will need to share Andrew’s vision with as many people as we can.</p>

            What can I do?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Take the time to listen to Andrew lay out his vision and then critically think about it. If it resonates as much for you as it did for me you will want to share it with everyone.
          </p>
          <p>Please do that. Talk to your parents, talk to your kids, talk to your friends, talk to your co-workers. Get a <a href="https://shop.yang2020.com/collections/signs" title="Andrew Yang Yard Signs">yard sign</a> and a <a href="https://shop.yang2020.com/collections/bumper-stickers" title="Andrew Yang Bumper Stickers">bumper sticker</a>. Let’s get his name recognition up.</p>

          <p>I like all of the candidates, but we need more out-of-the box thinking. Andrew’s three main policies create a strong economic base for all Americans.</p>
